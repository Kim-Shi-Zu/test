# Network Topology Explorer

A command-line tool for exploring and visualizing different network topology types including Star, Bus, Ring, and Mesh networks.

## Installation

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package
pip install .
```

## Usage

The `nettopo` CLI tool provides several commands to work with network topologies:

```bash
# List available topology types
nettopo list

# Get detailed description of a specific topology
nettopo describe star
nettopo describe bus
nettopo describe ring
nettopo describe mesh

# Render an ASCII visualization of a topology
nettopo render star --nodes 5
nettopo render bus --nodes 4
nettopo render ring --nodes 6
nettopo render mesh --nodes 4
```

## Development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest
```
