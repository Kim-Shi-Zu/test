## Summary  
Networking fundamentals cover the essential building blocks of digital communication, including core devices like hosts, routers, and switches that form the backbone of modern networks citeturn0search2turn0search1. These fundamentals also encompass common topologies—bus, star, ring, mesh—and their trade-offs, which dictate how data flows between devices citeturn0search3turn0search14. In addition, understanding the OSI and TCP/IP models clarifies how different protocol layers interact to reliably transmit information across varied media citeturn0search4turn0search5. Finally, a practical mini-project reinforces theory by guiding learners to build a tool that visualizes and explores network topologies in a CLI environment citeturn0search15turn0search13.

## User Prompt: Lesson 2.1 Outline with Projects  
> Using the System Prompt as context, please generate a detailed outline for **Lesson 2.1: Networking Fundamentals**, focusing on foundational concepts such as network devices, topologies, and protocol models citeturn0search2turn0search4.  
> For each outline item, include these fields: `lesson_title`, `key_topics`, `learning_objectives`, `doc_refs` (paths in `python-3.13-docs/`, e.g., `library/socket.html`), `project_name`, `project_slug`, and `project_folder` citeturn0search0turn0search20.  
> Design a mini-project named **Network Topology Explorer** (`network-topology-explorer`, `components/projects/network-topology-explorer`) that allows learners to discover and visualize common network topologies via clear CLI commands citeturn0search3turn0search14.  
> Ensure the mini-project outline specifies realistic input parameters, expected outputs, and a concise README guiding users through installation and usage steps.
